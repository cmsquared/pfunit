Tom, we might consider putting the attached buildScripts directory at the top level of the pFUnit source tree.  To build, I did the following:

p01923@swan:~> pwd
/home/users/p01923
p01923@swan:~> cp -R buildScripts/ berry/pFUnit-berry-branch/
p01923@swan:~> cd berry/
p01923@swan:~/berry> ls
pFUnit-berry-branch  pFUnit-dev-branch
p01923@swan:~/berry> mkdir berry-build
p01923@swan:~/berry> cd berry-build/
p01923@swan:~/berry/berry-build> ../pFUnit-berry-branch/buildScripts/setup-pFUnit-env 

**** Setting up environment for building pFUnit ****

  F90 = ftn
  CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER = ftn
  MPIF90 = ftn
  MPIRUN = aprun
  PFUNIT_MAX_RANK = 8
  DOXYGEN = /usr/bin/doxygen
  INSTALL_PATH = /home/users/p01923/bin/pFUnit
  PFUNIT = /home/users/p01923/bin/pFUnit

**** Done setting up environment for building pFUnit ****

p01923@swan:~/berry/berry-build> ../pFUnit-berry-branch/buildScripts/cray-compiler-cmake-mpi.sh

after which “make” and “make install” complete successfully.  The same also works with buildScripts/cray-compiler-serial.sh.
